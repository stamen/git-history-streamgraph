# git-history-streamgraph

This project aims to visualize git history as streamgraphs.

It draws from the following previous work:

- [Ian Johnson's set of scripts to pull the git history](https://gist.github.com/enjalot/688b9026ed865a790bfb390fca9c9b67)
- [Curran's fork of Ian's Gist](https://gist.github.com/curran/18287ef2c4b64ffba32000aad47c292b)
- [Curran's fork that ingests Stamen repositories](https://gist.github.com/curran/eff347bdee768044b742a4b2ed56254c)
